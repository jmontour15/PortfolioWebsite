# My Portfoio Website
I am a fourth year student at the University of Vermont majoring in biomedical engineering and minoring in conputer science. This repository will document the creation of my portfolio website as I continue to post projects and develop my web development skills.

### Current Progress
Currently, I am learning basic HTML and CSS. My next steps are to start learning JavaScript and Tailwind.
